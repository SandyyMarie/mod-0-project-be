## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- Sometimes I feel the technique is very useful but other times I do feel as though it risks interrupting my work flow. I like the idea of more bite sized pieces of work.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- I learned my time estimates are totally off, generally too short and I become distracted watching the time or too long where I binge entire sections in a sitting.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
- With a Hash you can assign values to the keys within the Array and hash's can be assigned to anything.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {Dog Toys: 20, Leashes: 15, Bandanas: 7}

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
- p states["IA"]

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
p states.keys
p states.values

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
Hash's are great for templates especially such as workforces trying to keep track of employee names, numbers, and dates such as start dates to particular people vs in an array where the information is less organized to a given employee.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
I just want to practice more to make sure I'm not confusing myself.
