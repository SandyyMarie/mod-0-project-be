## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  - I think what I've really been impressed by is the continued emphasis on asking for help and not being ashamed to reach out. I really like the sense of community from this career where everyone is trying to help each other problem solve. Another aspect is that employers will constantly give you projects that challenge your skills and force you to problem solve and grow - it's exciting to feel like you're helping solve a problem on a large scale.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  - I believe I demonstrate the growth mindset by being open minded to learning new techniques and getting feedback from others. Ways I do _not_ show that mindset is when I'm too stubborn to ask for help when I get stuck on something. I need to get better at finding the line between still encouraging my own growth by problem solving but also knowing when enough time has passed that I should be reaching out to clarify.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  - A conditional statement is when you utilize operators such as equal, greater than, less than, etc to evaluate true or false statements.

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  - You would want to use an if-statement because there are many instances where a variable changing alters what you need a code to do so this gives the opportunity to have multiple paths that can adapt given then value.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  - In Ruby youse use if/elsif/else structures.

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
  - You can keep adding elsif's until you're done and then wrapping it up with an else.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
  - def weather_status(temp)
      if temp >= 66
        p "It's Hot today"
      elsif temp <= 66 && temp >= 36
        p "It's Cool today"
      else
        p "It's Cold today"
      end
